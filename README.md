## Contour Module <a name="cont"></a>

This repository consists my professional work which shows the work done to extract data
from payslips.

## Deep Fake Face detection using colour components <a name="deeo"></a>

This is one the projects done as part of my course work which helps us distinguish real 
images from fake images created using Deep convolutional generative adversarial networks which 
analysis the different color components and classifies using SVM.
