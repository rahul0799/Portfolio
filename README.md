## Deep Fake Face detection using colour components <a name="deeo"></a>

This is one the projects done as part of my course work which helps us distinguish real 
images from fake images created using Deep convolutional generative adversarial networks which 
analysis the different color components and classifies using SVM. 

The other projects pursued as part of my company work cannot be uploaded here.
